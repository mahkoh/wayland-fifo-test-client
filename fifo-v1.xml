    <description summary="protocol for fifo constraints">
      When a Wayland compositor considers applying a content update,
      it must ensure all the update's readiness constraints (fences, etc)
      are met.

      This protocol provides a way to use the completion of a display refresh
      cycle as an additional readiness constraint.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        Establish a fifo object for a surface that may be used to add
        display refresh constraints to content updates.

        Only one such object may exist for a surface and attempting
        to create more than one will result in a fifo_manager_already_exists
        protocol error. If a surface is acted on by multiple software
        components, general best practice is that only the component
        performing wl_surface.attach operations should use this protocol.

        Indicate that this content update is not ready until the latching
        deadline for the vertical sync following the vertical refresh
        interval for which the previous buffer was latched.

        This constraint is satisfied immediately if a surface is not being
        updated by the compositor (off-screen, occluded, or a subsurface
        in synchronized mode) or if no buffer was previously attached.

        fifo is double buffered state, and will be applied at the
        time wl_surface.commit of the corresponding wl_surface is called.

        Since this object operates on a single specific surface, it makes
        no sense to make requests on it after the associated surface
        is destroyed.

        Attempting to do so will result in the generation of a
        "surface_destroyed" error.
